App for making shorter long links.                                                                                         
Use MongoDB Atlas, Express.js, Node.js, React.js.                                                                                                              Server with front and back on AWS EC2.
Link: http://35.180.123.94:3100/

(temporary doesn't work redirecting from shorted link to real, because I have changed my Amazon server (prefix of shorted links need to change too))
